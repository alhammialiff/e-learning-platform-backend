# Backend for E-Learning Platform

## Background
This backend server is developed to serve API requests from the frontend.

## What it does
While it is WIP at the moment, it aims to handle these from the frontend and DB:
1. Course creation 
2. Course retrieval
3. Course multimedia storage
4. Serving of course multimedia 
5. Authentication
6. Authorization management (via JWT Token)
7. Session Management (via Express-Sessions)
8. User Management

## Where do I aim to host this Mock E-learning Platform?
1. Probably merge both front-end and back-end repos together into a single repo with shared project directory
2. Replace DB dummy data with one that exists within project directory
3. Post it on Github Page.

## Backend Tools
**Framework** - Express Typescript
**DB CRUD Handler** - PG-Promise
**CORS Proxy** - CORS
**Unstructured Data Handling** - Multer

WIP.
